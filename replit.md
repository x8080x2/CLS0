# Telegram Domain Provisioning Bot

## Overview

This is a Telegram bot application that provides automated domain provisioning services with cPanel integration. The bot allows users to purchase hosting accounts, manage their balance, and deploy redirect scripts through a simple Telegram interface. It includes features like payment management, admin controls, rate limiting, and comprehensive logging.

## System Architecture

The application follows a monolithic Node.js architecture with the following key components:

- **Telegram Bot Interface**: Built using the Telegraf framework for handling Telegram interactions
- **Express Web Server**: Provides a dashboard interface and webhook endpoints
- **WHM/cPanel Integration**: Automated hosting account creation via WHM API
- **Payment System**: User balance management with admin approval workflow
- **File-based Data Storage**: Uses local file system for data persistence (no database currently implemented)

## Key Components

- **Key Features**: 
  - User command processing (/start, /help, /cancel)
  - Payment request handling
  - Domain provisioning workflow
  - Admin access controls
  - Rate limiting (3 requests per minute per user)

### 2. Web Dashboard (`dashboard.html`)
- **Purpose**: Provides a web-based interface for monitoring bot activity
- **Features**: 
  - Modern responsive design with gradient styling
  - Bot statistics and overview
  - Real-time monitoring capabilities

### 3. Script Templates

- **Deployment**: Production-ready configuration options

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the bot via Telegram commands
2. **Request Processing**: Bot processes requests with rate limiting and validation
3. **Payment Workflow**: Balance top-up requests require admin approval
4. **Domain Provisioning**:
